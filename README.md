# Breast-cancer-grading
Breast cancer grading guided by nuclei-related features in HE-stained pathological images

Our released dataset includes a total of 3644 H&E stained breast invasive ductal carcinoma pathological images. Among them, 2486 images were acquired under 20X magnification and 1158 images were acquired under 40X magnification.

The first number of the file name of each pathological image indicates its corresponding breast invasive ductal carcinoma grading. For example, “1—YYY24783-8-HE-40x-1.jpg” corresponds to grade 1,”2—YYY05842-9-HE-40x-12.jpg” corresponds to grade 2, and “3—YYY23286-21-20x-8.jpg” corresponds to grade 3.

In addition to downloading the dataset from our lab website, we have added two new download routes via Google Drive and Baidu Netdisk. The download link is as follows:
